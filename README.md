# sprite-generator

Browser-based application to quickly map sprites on a spritesheet. The final mapping can be saved as a .json file. This file can also be loaded later. The app features arrow-key operated interface to select the frame with, a dynamically editable rubber band that indicates the selection, auto whitespace trimming and editing of existing states by removing individual frames.

## Controls

The arrow keys navigate the rubber band on the left. The space bar commits the current selection to the current state. You can name the state to later easily map to it. States can be added or removed on the right dynamically.
